    One-compartment IV Bolus model with Michaelis-Menten (saturable) elimination.
    Parameterized by Max Elimination Rate (vmax), Michaelis Constant (km),
    and Volume of Distribution (vd).

    Used when elimination process (e.g., enzyme metabolism, transport) can
    become saturated at higher concentrations.

    States (y):
        y[0]: Mass in Central Compartment (amount)

    Parameters (*params for ode/mass_to_depvar):
        vmax (float): Maximum rate of elimination (amount/time).
        km (float): Michaelis constant (concentration units). Concentration at
                     which elimination rate is half of Vmax.
        vd (float): Volume of distribution of the central compartment (volume).

    Initial Conditions (y0 for ODE solver):
        For a single IV bolus dose `Dose` at t=0:
        y0 = [Dose]

    Initial Parameter Estimates (for optimization):
        - vmax: Represents the maximum elimination capacity. Harder to estimate directly.
                Related to CL at low concentrations (CL_low_C â‰ˆ Vmax/Km). Units are amount/time.
                Check literature for related enzyme kinetics or drugs.
        - km: Concentration at half-maximal elimination rate. Units are concentration.
              If data shows non-linear elimination (e.g., semi-log plot not straight),
              Km might be within the observed concentration range. Check literature.
        - vd: Volume relating mass to concentration (C = Mass/Vd). Might be estimated
              from low-dose data (where kinetics approximate first-order) using
              linear methods, or from literature.
        Estimation often requires data covering a range of concentrations, including
        those high enough to approach saturation. Initial guesses can be challenging.
